number of solutions:

NO --
    assumes board at "size" is square
        recursive plan works on "columns" (files)
        "size 1" has 1 x 8 squares -- all squares on file a

    2x2 board
        one queen only
        4 solutions (each square is solution)

    3x3
        2 queens only

        14 solutions
        - first queen on:
            rank 1: 6
                for each file a, b, c -- two locations for second queen
            rank 2: 4
                two second queen spots for files a, c; none for b
            rank 3: 6
                same as 1

        estimate 12 solutions
        - permutations of queen on rank 1: 3        -- WRONG
        CHECK:
        - all placements on other ranks are emulations of permutations of rank 1 on rotated board
            or, permutations on queen on rank 3, files a and c
            because each solution doing permutations on queen on another rank involve queen on that "base" rank
            -   NO -- if Qa2, solution at Qc3, or Qc1 -- former would not be in the "base queen" permutations

        - so total solutions are 3 * 4

        BUT
            overlaps?
