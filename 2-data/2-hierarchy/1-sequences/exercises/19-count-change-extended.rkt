;; Usage of revised procedure << cc >>

;; (define

; Exercise 2.19: 
; 
; Consider the change-counting program of Section 1.2.2. It would be nice to be
; able to easily change the currency used by the program, so that we could
; compute the number of ways to change a British pound, for example. As the
; program is wriî€¼en, the knowledge of the currency is distributed partly into the
; procedure first-denomination and partly into the procedure count-change (which
; knows that there are five kinds of U.S. coins). It would be nicer to be able to
; supply a list of coins to be used for making change.  We want to rewrite the
; procedure cc so that its second ar- gument is a list of the values of the coins
; to use rather than an integer specifying which coins to use. We could then have
; lists that defined each kind of currency:
; 
; (define us-coins (list 50 25 10 5 1))
; (define uk-coins (list 100 50 20 10 5 2 1 0.5))
; We could then call cc as follows:
; (cc 100 us-coins) 292
; 140
; 
; To do this will require changing the program cc somewhat. It will still have
; the same form, but it will access its second argument differently, as follows:
; 
; (define (cc amount coin-values)
;     (cond ((= amount 0)
;      1)
;     ((or (< amount 0)
;          (no-more? coin-values))
;      0)
;    (else
;     (+ (cc
;         amount
;         (except-first-denomination
;          coin-values))
;        (cc
;         (- amount
;            (first-denomination
;             coin-values))
;         coin-values)))))
; 
; Define the procedures 
; 
;     first-denomination,
;     except-first- denomination, and 
;     no-more? 
;     
;     in terms of primitive oper- ations on list structures. Does the order of
;     the list coin- values affect the answer produced by cc? Why or why not?
; 
; 
; Answer:
; The order of coins in the coin-values argument does not matter, because the recursion creates (and counts) a branch for each possible combination of coins regardless of the order in which they are provided.
