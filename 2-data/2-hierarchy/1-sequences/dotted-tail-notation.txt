Designating arguments with a dot << . >> passes all arguments following (an arbitrary number) to a list, held in the argument after the dot

    (define (same-parity . items) . . . 

        means that all arguments to << same-parity >> are passed to the list << items >>

        so after

            (same-parity 1 2 3)

                << items >> has the value '(1 2 3)


arguments before the dot are assigned as usual
