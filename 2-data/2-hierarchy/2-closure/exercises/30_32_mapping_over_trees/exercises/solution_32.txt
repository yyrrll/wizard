Exercise 2.32.

We can represent a set as a list of distinct elements, and we can represent the
set of all subsets of the set as a list of lists. For example, if the set is 

    (1 2 3) , 

then the set of all subsets is 

    (() (3) (2) (2 3) (1) (1 3) (1 2) (1 2 3)) .

Complete the following definition of a procedure that generates the set of
subsets of a set and give a clear explanation of why it works:


(define (subsets s)
  (if (null? s)
      (list nil)
      (let ((rest (subsets (cdr s))))
        (append rest (map <??> rest)))))


SOLUTION:

(lambda (element)
    (append (list (car s)) element))


WHY IT WORKS

The lambda inserted appends the list of the first element of s to all the
possibles subsets of the elements of s after the first element.  These subsets
include the empty set '().  When the list of the first element is appended to
the the empty list, the result is the list of the first element.  Thus the
function provides all the possible subsets that include the first element.


TODO:

1)  clean up explanation

2)  revise solution to give procedure bound to the particular value of the
    first element
