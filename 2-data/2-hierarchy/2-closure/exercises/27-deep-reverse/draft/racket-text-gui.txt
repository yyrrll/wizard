Using Racket / DrRacket from the command line

Invoke:

    racket

Load a file:

    ,enter [file.rkt]

        this reads the file into the context
        - there is also a load command, don't know what it does


Edit a file:

    ,edit [file.rkt]

        unless there is an $EDITOR variable (in the shell environment, yes?), the text interface will attempt to invoke drracket and edit there

            if there are problems with the file, gets errors and pauses

            NB: drracket not loading files for me here


Get help:

    ,help


        has commands such as:

            trace
            errortrace
            profile
            shell (run a shell command)

Trace

    ,trace function-name

        when the function is called, environment prints each call and the arguments passed to it
            does not seem to provide local context for errors
            - reports "expected: list given '(9 . *)" -- happening in an append call -- but doesn't give detail on which lines generated the offending object
                - OR DOES IT?

To exit:

    ,exit

        or

    (exit)
