Motivations:

build intuitions 
-   creating and manipulating structured data ?
-   extracting data from complex data objects
-   manipulate compound objects with type and characteristic diversity

    -   object diversity:
            mobiles
            branches
    
    -   characteristic diversity

            mobiles
                - branch (left side)
                - branch (right side)
    
            branches
                - rod length
                - structure
    
            rod length
                magnitude|integer (cm?)
    
            structure
                mobile or weight
    
            weight
                magnitude|integer (kilos?)



Learnings:

- clear diagram of data structure very helpful
- see composition of data structure in several patterns
    composition of defined objects
    from primitives

- note solution is "nested recursive"
    "tautological recursion"?

    total-weight calls branch-weight, passing it each of the mobile's two branchs
        branch-weight may call total-weight

        recursion not obvious in either, standing alone, but each leads to the other
