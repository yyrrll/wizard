must implement order of operations

code getting excessively complicated 
-- not coding at right levels / representations
-- solving problems with hacks rather than rethinking core representation


interface failing -- returning mix of postfix and infix
infix-deriv failing on error

code becoming example of coding by hacking / solving local problems rather than
thinking through the interface and representations
